# Bastion bot for Reddit

A free and open-source Reddit bot for looking up cards and other useful information about the
_Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game_ and _Official Card Game_. This is a port of the
[Discord bot](https://github.com/DawnbrandBots/bastion-bot).

## Getting started

Create a Python 3 [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io) and install dependencies with
[pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools):

```bash
virtualenv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install pip-tools
cd src
pip-sync
```

Configure a [`.env`](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv) file with the credentials for the Reddit bot account:

```dotenv
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=
REDDIT_USERNAME=
REDDIT_PASSWORD=
SUBREDDITS=yugioh+yugioh101
```

Run the bot with your IDE or in the shell!

```bash
python3 src/bastion.py
```
